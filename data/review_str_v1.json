It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn\\'t give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that\\'s dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it\\'s the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose in support aren\\'t faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the \"Birdman Of Shawshank,\" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there\\'s Roger Deakins\\' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman\\'s score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy\\'s state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you love Shawshank then it\\'s a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10'}, {'user': 'tmdb73913433', 'rating': 6.0, 'content': 'Make way for the best film ever made people. **Make way.**'}]}"

Loke\\nSummary: This article highlights quantum Internet computing as referring to\\ndistributed quantum computing over the quantum Internet, analogous to\\n(classical) Internet computing involving (classical) distributed computing over\\nthe (classical) Internet. Relevant to quantum Internet computing would be areas\\nof study such as quantum protocols for distributed nodes using quantum\\ninformation for computations, quantum cloud computing, delegated verifiable\\nblind or private computing, non-local gates, and distributed quantum\\napplications, over Internet-scale distances.\\n\\nPublished: 2000-03-31\\nTitle: Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices\\nAuthors: Seth Lloyd\\nSummary: This paper investigates a variety of unconventional quantum computation\\ndevices, including fermionic quantum computers and computers that exploit\\nnonlinear quantum mechanics. It is shown that unconventional quantum computing\\ndevices can in principle compute some quantities more rapidly than\\n`conventional' quantum computers.\\n\\nPublished: 2013-11-20\\nTitle: Geometrical perspective on quantum states and quantum computation\\nAuthors: Zeqian Chen\\nSummary: We interpret quantum computing as a geometric evolution process by\\nreformulating finite quantum systems via Connes' noncommutative geometry. In\\nthis formulation, quantum states are represented as noncommutative connections,\\nwhile gauge transformations on the connections play a role of unitary quantum\\noperations. Thereby, a geometrical model for quantum computation is presented,\\nwhich is equivalent to the quantum circuit model. This result shows a geometric\\nway of realizing quantum computing and as such, provides an alternative\\nproposal of building a quantum computer.\"}"

I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

Inception is one of his masterpieces. It’s a science fiction film released in 2010 and written by undoubtedly one of the greatest directors in Hollywood, Christopher Nolan, the creator of such stunning films as ‘Memento’, ‘The dark knight’, Prestige’ and ‘Interstellar’. the cast is impressive: the main roles are played by Leo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine.\\n\\nThe film is based on the idea of lucid dreams. In the story, the professionals of industrial espionage, using special techniques to steal valuable secrets from the depths of the subconscious during sleep, when the human mind is most vulnerable, learn a new technique - the ‘inception’ of ideas into the human mind through his dream. The main character - Dom Cobb is a talented thief, his rare abilities made him a truly valuable player in the treacherous world of espionage, but they also turned him into a perennial fugitive and stripped him of everything he had ever loved. One day Cobb has a chance to correct mistakes. His latest case can bring everything back, but for that he needs to do the impossible - inception.\\n\\nThere are so many good things about the film. The plot of the film is definitely mind-blowing. You won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. The soundtrack is written by Hans Zimmer, who is certainly one of the most sought-after composers. I think all his music is incredibly touching, dramatic and powerful. There are also some iconic songs we all know. The work on the special effects is done flawlessly, evidently, a lot of money was spent on this. The acting is also wonderful, Leo DiCaprio, who was the first actor to accept the offer to play in the film, has done an amazing job.\\n\\nThe only thing that viewers can find bad about this film is that it can be extremely difficult to perceive. If you don’t watch the film close enough you can simply get lost in all these jumping from dreams to reality.\\n\\nA curious fact is that Christopher Nolan released the film in 2010 but started working on it at the beginning of the 2000s! I would recommend everyone to see the film, even if you are not interested in sci-fi.\", 'image': 'outputs/review3.jpg'}\nResponse: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'outputs/review3.jpg'"

Of course having Leonardo in the lead role helped a lot. From the trailer, I already know some things. Dreams. All about dreams. But what about dreams? Who are the other people? At first, I didn't really understand what was going on. It was all very confusing to me. But as the movie progresses, I start to understand it and I wanted to watch some more and know more what will happen in the end. The ending. That was, I think, the most intense ending of a movie in a year or probably more than a year. People actually screamed when the screen faded. And of course, people couldn't help but talk about it. It was an open-ended movie where people will have their own endings. My favorite part was Joseph Gordon's fight scene. I think he has the most fun part in this movie.\", 'image': 'outputs/review1.jpg'}\nResponse: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'outputs/review1.jpg'"

Inception is one of his masterpieces. It’s a science fiction film released in 2010 and written by undoubtedly one of the greatest directors in Hollywood, Christopher Nolan, the creator of such stunning films as ‘Memento’, ‘The dark knight’, Prestige’ and ‘Interstellar’. the cast is impressive: the main roles are played by Leo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film is based on the idea of lucid dreams. In the story, the professionals of industrial espionage, using special techniques to steal valuable secrets from the depths of the subconscious during sleep, when the human mind is most vulnerable, learn a new technique - the ‘inception’ of ideas into the human mind through his dream. The main character - Dom Cobb is a talented thief, his rare abilities made him a truly valuable player in the treacherous world of espionage, but they also turned him into a perennial fugitive and stripped him of everything he had ever loved. One day Cobb has a chance to correct mistakes. His latest case can bring everything back, but for that he needs to do the impossible - inception.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are so many good things about the film. The plot of the film is definitely mind-blowing. You won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. The soundtrack is written by Hans Zimmer, who is certainly one of the most sought-after composers. I think all his music is incredibly touching, dramatic and powerful. There are also some iconic songs we all know. The work on the special effects is done flawlessly, evidently, a lot of money was spent on this. The acting is also wonderful, Leo DiCaprio, who was the first actor to accept the offer to play in the film, has done an amazing job.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only thing that viewers can find bad about this film is that it can be extremely difficult to perceive. If you don’t watch the film close enough you can simply get lost in all these jumping from dreams to reality.\\r\\n\\r\\nA curious fact is that Christopher Nolan released the film in 2010 but started working on it at the beginning of the 2000s! I would recommend everyone to see the film, even if you are not interested in sci-fi.\"}]}"

They are available in several sources like the\\ntelevision guide, best-selling reference books, newspaper columns, and\\ntelevision programs. Furthermore, movie ratings are crucial for recommendation\\nengines that track the behavior of all users and utilize the information to\\nsuggest items they might like. Movie ratings in most cases, thus, provide\\ninformation that might be more important than movie feature-based data. It is\\nintuitively appealing that information about the viewing preferences in movie\\ngenres is sufficient for predicting a genre of an unlabeled movie. In order to\\npredict movie genres, we treat ratings as a feature vector, apply the Bernoulli\\nevent model to estimate the likelihood of a movies given genre, and evaluate\\nthe posterior probability of the genre of a given movie using the Bayes rule.\\nThe goal of the proposed technique is to efficiently use the movie ratings for\\nthe task of predicting movie genres. In our approach we attempted to answer the\\nquestion: \"Given the set of users who watched a movie, is it possible to\\npredict the genre of a movie based on its ratings?\" Our simulation results with\\nMovieLens 100k data demonstrated the efficiency and accuracy of our proposed\\ntechnique, achieving 59% prediction rate for exact prediction and 69% when\\nincluding correlated genres.\\n\\nPublished: 2019-10-24\\nTitle: A Graph-Based Framework to Bridge Movies and Synopses\\nAuthors: Yu Xiong, Qingqiu Huang, Lingfeng Guo, Hang Zhou, Bolei Zhou, Dahua Lin\\nSummary: Inspired by the remarkable advances in video analytics, research teams are\\nstepping towards a greater ambition -- movie understanding. However, compared\\nto those activity videos in conventional datasets, movies are significantly\\ndifferent. Generally, movies are much longer and consist of much richer\\ntemporal structures. More importantly, the interactions among characters play a\\ncentral role in expressing the underlying story. To facilitate the efforts\\nalong this direction, we construct a dataset called Movie Synopses Associations\\n(MSA) over 327 movies, which provides a synopsis for each movie, together with\\nannotated associations between synopsis paragraphs and movie segments. On top\\nof this dataset, we develop a framework to perform matching between movie\\nsegments and synopsis paragraphs. This framework integrates different aspects\\nof a movie, including event dynamics and character interactions, and allows\\nthem to be matched with parsed paragraphs, based on a graph-based formulation.\\nOur study shows that the proposed framework remarkably improves the matching\\naccuracy over conventional feature-based methods. It also reveals the\\nimportance of narrative structures and character interactions in movie\\nunderstanding.\\n\\nPublished: 2018-11-27\\nTitle: Movie Recommendation System using Sentiment Analysis from Microblogging Data\\nAuthors: Sudhanshu Kumar, Shirsendu Sukanta Halder, Kanjar De, Partha Pratim Roy\\nSummary: Recommendation systems are important intelligent systems that play a vital\\nrole in providing selective information to users. Traditional approaches in\\nrecommendation systems include collaborative filtering and content-based\\nfiltering. However, these approaches have certain limitations like the\\nnecessity of prior user history and habits for performing the task of\\nrecommendation. In order to reduce the effect of such dependencies, this paper\\nproposes a hybrid recommendation system which combines the collaborative\\nfiltering, content-based filtering with sentiment analysis of movie tweets. The\\nmovie tweets have been collected from microblogging websites to understand the\\ncurrent trends and user response of the movie. Experiments conducted on public\\ndatabase produce promising results.'}"

Many challenges still currently remain, and various\\nresearches related thereto have been actively conducted. Especially, recent\\nresearch of neural network-based financial market trend prediction has\\nattracted much attention. However, previous researches do not deal with the\\nfinancial market forecasting method based on LSTM which has good performance in\\ntime series data. There is also a lack of comparative analysis in the\\nperformance of neural network-based prediction techniques and traditional\\nprediction techniques. In this paper, we propose a financial market trend\\nforecasting method using LSTM and analyze the performance with existing\\nfinancial market trend forecasting methods through experiments. This method\\nprepares the input data set through the data preprocessing process so as to\\nreflect all the fundamental data, technical data and qualitative data used in\\nthe financial data analysis, and makes comprehensive financial market analysis\\nthrough LSTM. In this paper, we experiment and compare performances of existing\\nfinancial market trend forecasting models, and performance according to the\\nfinancial market environment. In addition, we implement the proposed method\\nusing open sources and platform and forecast financial market trends using\\nvarious financial data indicators.\\n\\nPublished: 2014-02-14\\nTitle: News Cohesiveness: an Indicator of Systemic Risk in Financial Markets\\nAuthors: Matija Piškorec, Nino Antulov-Fantulin, Petra Kralj Novak, Igor Mozetič, Miha Grčar, Irena Vodenska, Tomislav Šmuc\\nSummary: Motivated by recent financial crises significant research efforts have been\\nput into studying contagion effects and herding behaviour in financial markets.\\nMuch less has been said about influence of financial news on financial markets.\\nWe propose a novel measure of collective behaviour in financial news on the\\nWeb, News Cohesiveness Index (NCI), and show that it can be used as a systemic\\nrisk indicator. We evaluate the NCI on financial documents from large Web news\\nsources on a daily basis from October 2011 to July 2013 and analyse the\\ninterplay between financial markets and financially related news. We\\nhypothesized that strong cohesion in financial news reflects movements in the\\nfinancial markets. Cohesiveness is more general and robust measure of systemic\\nrisk expressed in news, than measures based on simple occurrences of specific\\nterms. Our results indicate that cohesiveness in the financial news is highly\\ncorrelated with and driven by volatility on the financial markets.\\n\\nPublished: 2015-03-03\\nTitle: Understanding Financial Market States Using Artificial Double Auction Market\\nAuthors: Kyubin Yim, Gabjin Oh, Seunghwan Kim\\nSummary: The ultimate value of theories of the fundamental mechanisms comprising the\\nasset price in financial systems will be reflected in the capacity of such\\ntheories to understand these systems. Although the models that explain the\\nvarious states of financial markets offer substantial evidences from the fields\\nof finance, mathematics, and even physics to explain states observed in the\\nreal financial markets, previous theories that attempt to fully explain the\\ncomplexities of financial markets have been inadequate. In this study, we\\npropose an artificial double auction market as an agent-based model approach to\\nstudy the origin of complex states in the financial markets, characterizing\\nimportant parameters with an investment strategy that can cover the dynamics of\\nthe financial market. The investment strategy of chartist traders after market\\ninformation arrives should reduce market stability originating in the price\\nfluctuations of risky assets. However, fundamentalist traders strategically\\nsubmit orders with a fundamental value and, thereby stabilize the market. We\\nconstruct a continuous double auction market and find that the market is\\ncontrolled by a fraction of chartists, P_{c}. We show that mimicking real\\nfinancial markets state, which emerges in real financial systems, is given\\nbetween approximately P_{c} = 0.40 and P_{c} = 0.85, but that mimicking the\\nefficient market hypothesis state can be generated in a range of less than\\nP_{c} = 0.40.

Relevant to quantum Internet computing would be areas\\nof study such as quantum protocols for distributed nodes using quantum\\ninformation for computations, quantum cloud computing, delegated verifiable\\nblind or private computing, non-local gates, and distributed quantum\\napplications, over Internet-scale distances.\\n\\nPublished: 2000-03-31\\nTitle: Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices\\nAuthors: Seth Lloyd\\nSummary: This paper investigates a variety of unconventional quantum computation\\ndevices, including fermionic quantum computers and computers that exploit\\nnonlinear quantum mechanics. It is shown that unconventional quantum computing\\ndevices can in principle compute some quantities more rapidly than\\n`conventional' quantum computers.\\n\\nPublished: 2013-11-20\\nTitle: Geometrical perspective on quantum states and quantum computation\\nAuthors: Zeqian Chen\\nSummary: We interpret quantum computing as a geometric evolution process by\\nreformulating finite quantum systems via Connes' noncommutative geometry. In\\nthis formulation, quantum states are represented as noncommutative connections,\\nwhile gauge transformations on the connections play a role of unitary quantum\\noperations. Thereby, a geometrical model for quantum computation is presented,\\nwhich is equivalent to the quantum circuit model. This result shows a geometric\\nway of realizing quantum computing and as such, provides an alternative\\nproposal of building a quantum computer.\"}"

This\\npaper addresses the positive and negative implications computer vision based\\nassistive technologies have on individuals with visual impairment, as well as\\nconsiderations for computer vision researchers and developers in order to\\nmitigate the amount of negative implications.\\n\\nPublished: 2013-11-03\\nTitle: Second Croatian Computer Vision Workshop (CCVW 2013)\\nAuthors: Sven Lončarić, Siniša Šegvić\\nSummary: Proceedings of the Second Croatian Computer Vision Workshop (CCVW 2013,\\nhttp://www.fer.unizg.hr/crv/ccvw2013) held September 19, 2013, in Zagreb,\\nCroatia. Workshop was organized by the Center of Excellence for Computer Vision\\nof the University of Zagreb.\\n\\nPublished: 2017-05-28\\nTitle: Multiband NFC for High-Throughput Wireless Computer Vision Sensor Network\\nAuthors: F. Li, J. Du\\nSummary: Vision sensors lie in the heart of computer vision. In many computer vision\\napplications, such as AR/VR, non-contacting near-field communication (NFC) with\\nhigh throughput is required to transfer information to algorithms. In this\\nwork, we proposed a novel NFC system which utilizes multiple frequency bands to\\nachieve high throughput.'}"

Inception is one of his masterpieces. It’s a science fiction film released in 2010 and written by undoubtedly one of the greatest directors in Hollywood, Christopher Nolan, the creator of such stunning films as ‘Memento’, ‘The dark knight’, Prestige’ and ‘Interstellar’. the cast is impressive: the main roles are played by Leo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film is based on the idea of lucid dreams. In the story, the professionals of industrial espionage, using special techniques to steal valuable secrets from the depths of the subconscious during sleep, when the human mind is most vulnerable, learn a new technique - the ‘inception’ of ideas into the human mind through his dream. The main character - Dom Cobb is a talented thief, his rare abilities made him a truly valuable player in the treacherous world of espionage, but they also turned him into a perennial fugitive and stripped him of everything he had ever loved. One day Cobb has a chance to correct mistakes. His latest case can bring everything back, but for that he needs to do the impossible - inception.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are so many good things about the film. The plot of the film is definitely mind-blowing. You won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. The soundtrack is written by Hans Zimmer, who is certainly one of the most sought-after composers. I think all his music is incredibly touching, dramatic and powerful. There are also some iconic songs we all know. The work on the special effects is done flawlessly, evidently, a lot of money was spent on this. The acting is also wonderful, Leo DiCaprio, who was the first actor to accept the offer to play in the film, has done an amazing job.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only thing that viewers can find bad about this film is that it can be extremely difficult to perceive. If you don’t watch the film close enough you can simply get lost in all these jumping from dreams to reality.\\r\\n\\r\\nA curious fact is that Christopher Nolan released the film in 2010 but started working on it at the beginning of the 2000s! I would recommend everyone to see the film, even if you are not interested in sci-fi.\"}]}"

Relevant to quantum Internet computing would be areas\\nof study such as quantum protocols for distributed nodes using quantum\\ninformation for computations, quantum cloud computing, delegated verifiable\\nblind or private computing, non-local gates, and distributed quantum\\napplications, over Internet-scale distances.\\n\\nPublished: 2000-03-31\\nTitle: Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices\\nAuthors: Seth Lloyd\\nSummary: This paper investigates a variety of unconventional quantum computation\\ndevices, including fermionic quantum computers and computers that exploit\\nnonlinear quantum mechanics. It is shown that unconventional quantum computing\\ndevices can in principle compute some quantities more rapidly than\\n`conventional' quantum computers.\\n\\nPublished: 2013-11-20\\nTitle: Geometrical perspective on quantum states and quantum computation\\nAuthors: Zeqian Chen\\nSummary: We interpret quantum computing as a geometric evolution process by\\nreformulating finite quantum systems via Connes' noncommutative geometry. In\\nthis formulation, quantum states are represented as noncommutative connections,\\nwhile gauge transformations on the connections play a role of unitary quantum\\noperations. Thereby, a geometrical model for quantum computation is presented,\\nwhich is equivalent to the quantum circuit model. This result shows a geometric\\nway of realizing quantum computing and as such, provides an alternative\\nproposal of building a quantum computer.\"}"

These explanations are often used to qualitatively assess\\nother criteria such as safety or non-discrimination. However, despite the\\ninterest in interpretability, there is very little consensus on what\\ninterpretable machine learning is and how it should be measured. In this\\nposition paper, we first define interpretability and describe when\\ninterpretability is needed (and when it is not). Next, we suggest a taxonomy\\nfor rigorous evaluation and expose open questions towards a more rigorous\\nscience of interpretable machine learning.\\n\\nPublished: 2018-07-25\\nTitle: Machine Learning Interpretability: A Science rather than a tool\\nAuthors: Abdul Karim, Avinash Mishra, MA Hakim Newton, Abdul Sattar\\nSummary: The term \"interpretability\" is oftenly used by machine learning researchers\\neach with their own intuitive understanding of it. There is no universal well\\nagreed upon definition of interpretability in machine learning. As any type of\\nscience discipline is mainly driven by the set of formulated questions rather\\nthan by different tools in that discipline, e.g. astrophysics is the discipline\\nthat learns the composition of stars, not as the discipline that use the\\nspectroscopes. Similarly, we propose that machine learning interpretability\\nshould be a discipline that answers specific questions related to\\ninterpretability. These questions can be of statistical, causal and\\ncounterfactual nature. Therefore, there is a need to look into the\\ninterpretability problem of machine learning in the context of questions that\\nneed to be addressed rather than different tools. We discuss about a\\nhypothetical interpretability framework driven by a question based scientific\\napproach rather than some specific machine learning model. Using a question\\nbased notion of interpretability, we can step towards understanding the science\\nof machine learning rather than its engineering. This notion will also help us\\nunderstanding any specific problem more in depth rather than relying solely on\\nmachine learning methods.\\n\\nPublished: 2019-05-19\\nTitle: Techniques for Interpretable Machine Learning\\nAuthors: Mengnan Du, Ninghao Liu, Xia Hu\\nSummary: Interpretable machine learning tackles the important problem that humans\\ncannot understand the behaviors of complex machine learning models and how\\nthese models arrive at a particular decision. Although many approaches have\\nbeen proposed, a comprehensive understanding of the achievements and challenges\\nis still lacking. We provide a survey covering existing techniques to increase\\nthe interpretability of machine learning models. We also discuss crucial issues\\nthat the community should consider in future work such as designing\\nuser-friendly explanations and developing comprehensive evaluation metrics to\\nfurther push forward the area of interpretable machine learning.'}"
