The theorem states that there are no integer solutions to the equation:\n\na^n + b^n = c^n\n\nwhere n is an integer greater than 2.\n\nHowever, this theorem was proven using advanced mathematics and computer simulations.

Consider a simple equation like:\n\n2^2 + 3^2 = 13\n\nThis equation meets the criteria of Fermat's Last Theorem because both sides are perfect squares and can be expressed as the product of two integers.\n\nNow consider an equation like:\n\n2^3 + 3^3 ≠ 7^3\n\nThis equation does not meet the criteria because one side is not a perfect square, and it cannot be expressed as the product of two integers.\n\nTherefore, Fermat's Last Theorem states that there are no integer solutions to the equation:\n\na^n + b^n = c^n\n\nwhen n is greater than 2.\n\nIn simpler terms, Fermat's Last Theorem states that it is impossible to find integers a, b, and c that satisfy the equation:\n\na^n + b^n = c^n\n\nwhen n is greater than 2.\n\nThis theorem has been debated by mathematicians for centuries and was considered one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics until Andrew Wiles solved it in 1994.\n\nIt's important to note that Fermat's Last Theorem is not a trivial result and requires a deep understanding of advanced mathematical concepts such as elliptic curves and modular forms. However, the concept behind the theorem can be understood using simple examples and explanations like the one above."}
