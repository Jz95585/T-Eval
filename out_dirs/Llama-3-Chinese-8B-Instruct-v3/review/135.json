What programming language would you recommend?\n\nI would recommend using Python for this task. Here's why:\n\n1. Python has a built-in module called `csv` that makes it easy to read and write CSV files. This module includes functions like `reader()` and `writer()` that allow you to read and write CSV files with ease.\n\n2. Python has a vast range of libraries and tools that can help you perform various operations on CSV files. For example, you can use libraries like `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis, `numpy` for numerical computations, and `matplotlib` for data visualization.\n\n3. Python is a high-level language that is easy to learn and use, even for beginners. It has a simple syntax and is very flexible, allowing you to write code that is efficient and readable.\n\n4. Python is widely used in data analysis and machine learning, making it a popular choice for working with CSV files.\n\nOverall, Python is an excellent choice for working with CSV files due to its ease of use, extensive libraries and tools, and versatility."}
