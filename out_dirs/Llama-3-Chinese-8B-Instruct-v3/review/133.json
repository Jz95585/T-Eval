'other_income_sources': ['Rental Income', 'Investment Income'] - The borrower has two additional income sources: rental income from properties and investment income from stocks or other investments.\n4. 'financial_stability_summary': 'Stable' - The overall financial stability of the borrower is considered stable based on their income sources.\n\nBased on this analysis, it appears that the borrower has a stable financial situation due to their regular employment income and additional income from rental properties and investments.

A more comprehensive analysis would require additional data points."}
