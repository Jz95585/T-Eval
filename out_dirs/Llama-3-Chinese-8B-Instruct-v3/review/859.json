The given name of the function is QualityManagementAnalysis.compare_markets, which suggests that this function is used to compare the quality management strategies between different markets. The function takes a parameter 'market' which contains a list of markets to compare. In this case, the parameter 'market' has a value of ['China', 'overseas']. Therefore, the function is expected to return the analysis of the quality management strategies in both the Chinese market and overseas market.\n\nThe response provided, \"The quality management strategies in the Chinese market are characterized by stringent regulatory compliance and a focus on domestic standards, while the overseas market emphasizes international standards and certifications. Both markets share common practices such as supplier audits and continuous improvement programs, but differ in their approach to risk management and innovation.\" supports the function name and parameter provided.
