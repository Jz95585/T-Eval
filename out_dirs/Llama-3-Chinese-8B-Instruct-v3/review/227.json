It is named after William F. Sharpe, who first developed the concept in the early 1960s. The sharp ratio is calculated using the following formula:\n\nSharp Ratio = (Expected Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Standard Deviation\n\nWhere:\n\nExpected Return is the expected return of the investment portfolio.\nRisk-Free Rate is the return of a risk-free investment, such as a government bond.\nStandard Deviation is a measure of the volatility of the investment portfolio.\n\nThe sharp ratio is used to compare the performance of different investment portfolios by taking into account the level of risk involved in each portfolio. A higher sharp ratio indicates that the portfolio has performed better than expected considering its level of risk. Conversely, a lower sharp ratio indicates that the portfolio has underperformed relative to its risk.\n\nIt is important to note that the sharp ratio is only applicable to a portfolio that has a positive expected return. If the expected return is negative, the sharp ratio will be undefined.\n\nIn the context of the given problem:\n\n目标：计算自动化策略的夏普比率。\n名称：InvestmentAnalytics.calculate_sharpe_ratio\n参数：{'strategy_id': 'auto_strategy_123', 'start_date': '2020-01-01', 'end_date': '2023-01-01'}\n响应：Sharpe Ratio: 1.25\n\nThe sharp ratio for the auto_strategy_123 portfolio was calculated using the expected return of the portfolio from January 2020 to January 2023, the risk-free rate during the same period, and the standard deviation of the portfolio returns. The resulting sharp ratio of 1.25 indicates that the portfolio has performed better than expected considering its level of risk."}
