Download a translation app: There are many translation apps available that can help you communicate with locals. Some popular options include Google Translate, TripLingo, and Jisho.\n\n3. Carry a phrasebook or dictionary: A physical phrasebook or dictionary can be very useful in situations where you don't have access to your phone or the internet.\n\n4. Learn common gestures: Familiarize yourself with common gestures used in Japan such as bowing, using both hands to give or receive something, and using your right hand to give or receive money.\n\n5. Look for signs and labels: Many restaurants, shops, and public facilities have English translations or pictures. Look for these signs and labels to help you navigate and communicate.\n\n6.
