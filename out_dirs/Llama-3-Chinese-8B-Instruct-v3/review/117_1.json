The API provides the following information based on the provided input:\n\n1. Investment Advice: The API suggests considering a diversified portfolio approach for the project \"The Wandering Earth II\" in the China market. This means that investors should spread their investment across multiple projects to manage risk and maximize returns.\n\n2. Risk Assessment: The API identifies the project as having moderate risk due to its high production budget. This suggests that while the project has potential for returns, there is a chance that it may not perform as well as expected, resulting in a less-than-desirable return on investment.\n\nIn conclusion, the FilmInvestmentAPI.get_investment_advice method provides valuable insights to investors seeking to invest in the film industry by offering targeted investment advice and risk assessments for specific projects.
