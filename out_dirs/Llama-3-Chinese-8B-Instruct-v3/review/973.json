This is primarily due to the reduction in interest rates, making it more financially advantageous for customers to repay their loans ahead of schedule. Additionally, the policy has also influenced customers to consider re-financing their loans to take advantage of the lower rates. Based on this analysis, banks should consider offering incentives for early repayment and provide clear communication on the benefits of re-financing to guide customer behavior."}], "prediction": "What is the difference between Absolute and Relative URLs?\n\nAbsolute URLs specify the full URL of a resource, including the protocol, domain name, and path. For example:\n\nhttp://example.com/path/to/resource/\n\nRelative URLs, on the other hand, specify the path to a resource relative to the current URL. For example:\n\n/path/to/resource/\n\nThe main difference between the two is that absolute URLs can be used independently, while relative URLs require a base URL to be defined in order to work correctly. Absolute URLs are often used in links that are meant to be used outside of a specific context or application, while relative URLs are typically used within an application or website where the base URL is already known.\n\nIn terms of SEO, absolute URLs are generally preferred because they provide more information to search engines about the structure and organization of a website. Relative URLs, on the other hand, can make it more difficult for search engines to crawl and index a website properly.\n\nIn summary, absolute URLs provide a complete and specific address to a resource, while relative URLs provide a path to a resource relative to the current location. Absolute URLs are preferred for SEO purposes, while relative URLs are often used within applications or websites where the base URL is already known."}
