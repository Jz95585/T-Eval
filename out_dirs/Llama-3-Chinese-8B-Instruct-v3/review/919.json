I have been working on a specific competition for weeks and have made good progress, but now I am facing a problem that I cannot solve.\n\nI have a dataset consisting of various features and a target variable. However, when I try to split the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn, I get an error message saying that the target variable must be the last column in the dataframe.\n\nHere is my code snippet:\n\n```\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')\nX = df.iloc[:, :-1] # features\ny = df.iloc[:, -1] # target variable\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n```\n\nThe error message I am getting is:\n\n```\nValueError: y should have the same length as X\n```\n\nI have already checked that the length of the target variable is the same as the length of the feature matrix, which means that they have the same number of rows.\n\nHere are the dimensions of the feature matrix and the target variable:\n\n```\nprint(X.shape)\nprint(y.shape)\n\nOutput:\n(40000, 13)\n(40000,)\n```\n\nI have also tried to reorder the columns of the dataframe before splitting the data, but that didn't solve the problem either.\n\nHere is the code snippet I used:\n\n```\ndf = df.iloc[:, [13]+list(range(13))]\nX = df.iloc[:, :-1]\ny = df.iloc[:, -1]\n```\n\nCan you please help me identify what might be causing the error and suggest a solution?\n\nThank you!"}
