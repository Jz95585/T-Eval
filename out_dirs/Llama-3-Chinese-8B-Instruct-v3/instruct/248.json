Here are the steps to do so:\n\nStep 1: Visit TSMC's website\nYou can visit TSMC's official website at https://www.tsmc.com/.\n\nStep 2: Navigate to the Investor Relations section\nOn the homepage, click on the \"Investor Relations\" tab located at the top right corner.\n\nStep 3: Access TSMC's financial reports\nUnder the Investor Relations section, click on \"Financial Reports\" and select the specific financial report you would like to access (e.g., Annual Report or Quarterly Report).\n\nStep 4: Search for production capacity data\nIn the financial report, look for sections related to production capacity, such as \"Capacity Utilization Rate\" or \"Factory Capacity\". This information will typically be found in the company's financial statements or in a separate section dedicated to capacity and manufacturing data.\n\nStep 5: Note down the data for the past three years\nOnce you find the production capacity data for each year, take note of the figures for the past three years. You can also download the financial report in PDF format for easier reference.\n\nStep 6: Analyze the data\nAfter obtaining the data, you can analyze it to evaluate TSMC's utilization rate of advanced manufacturing technology. Look for trends or fluctuations in the utilization rate over the past three years, and consider factors such as market demand, technology advancements, and competition in the industry.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to obtain and analyze TSMC's production capacity data for the past three years, which can help you assess the company's utilization rate of advanced manufacturing technology."}
