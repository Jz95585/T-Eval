The ability to access stock prices for a future date relies on information that is not yet available or publicly accessible.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with some general information about how to obtain historical stock data. You can visit reputable financial websites such as Yahoo Finance or Google Finance to access historical stock data for a specific company. These websites provide a range of historical stock data, including date, open, high, low, close, volume, and other related metrics.\n\nTo obtain historical stock data for Tesla (TSLA) on a specific date, such as December 1st, 2024, you would need to visit one of these financial websites and enter the company's ticker symbol and the desired date in the search bar. The website will then generate a chart showing the stock's historical data for that date.\n\nIt's important to note that stock prices are subject to market fluctuations and can change rapidly. Therefore, it's always a good idea to check the most recent stock prices and data directly from a financial website or financial news source if you need up-to-date information."}
