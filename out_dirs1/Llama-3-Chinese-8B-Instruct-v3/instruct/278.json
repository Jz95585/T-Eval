This data could be obtained from publicly available sources such as company reports, financial statements, or industry publications.\n\nStep 2: Define Capacity Utilization\n\nCapacity utilization is a metric that measures the efficiency of a company's production process by comparing the actual output to the maximum potential output. It is calculated as the ratio of the actual output to the maximum potential output.\n\nStep 3: Analyze Data\n\nOnce the data is collected, I would analyze it to understand how Kyocera has utilized its capacity in advanced manufacturing technologies over the past three years. I would look for trends and patterns in the data to identify any improvements or declines in capacity utilization.\n\nStep 4: Compare to Industry Benchmarks\n\nTo put Kyocera's performance into perspective, I would compare its capacity utilization in advanced manufacturing technologies to industry benchmarks or average industry performance. This would provide insights into whether Kyocera's performance is above or below the industry average.\n\nStep 5: Draw Conclusions\n\nBased on the analysis of the data and comparison to industry benchmarks, I would draw conclusions about Kyocera's capacity utilization in advanced manufacturing technologies. This could include identifying areas of improvement, highlighting successful strategies or initiatives that have led to increased capacity utilization, or noting areas where the company may need to focus on increasing efficiency.\n\nAPI Call:\nKyoceraAPI.get_capacity_data(company='Kyocera', years=3, technology=['陶瓷制造', '智能制造'])"}
