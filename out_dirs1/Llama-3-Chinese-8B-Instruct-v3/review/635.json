The SustainabilityCostAnalyzer.analyze_costs function takes two parameters: bank_names (a list of bank names) and fee_reduction (a boolean indicating whether to reduce fees or not). Based on the given parameters, the function returns a dictionary with the following structure:\n\n{\n    'BankA': {'cost_before': cost_before_A, 'cost_after': cost_after_A, 'savings': savings_A},\n    'BankB': {'cost_before': cost_before_B, 'cost_after': cost_after_B, 'savings': savings_B},\n    ...\n}\n\nWhere cost_before_X represents the sustainability cost before the reduction of service fees for bank X, cost_after_X represents the sustainability cost after the reduction, and savings_X represents the amount saved in terms of sustainability cost for bank X.\n\nTo achieve this, we will need to gather data on the sustainability costs of each bank before and after the reduction of service fees. We can then use this data to calculate the savings for each bank.\n\nHere is a sample implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_costs(bank_names, fee_reduction):\n    result = {}\n    \n    # Gather data on sustainability costs before and after fee reduction\n    for bank in bank_names:\n        cost_before = get_sustainability_cost(bank)\n        if fee_reduction:\n            cost_after = get_sustainability_cost_after_fee_reduction(bank)\n        else:\n            cost_after = get_sustainability_cost(bank)\n        \n        savings = cost_before - cost_after\n        \n        result[bank] = {'cost_before': cost_before, 'cost_after': cost_after, 'savings': savings}\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we loop through each bank name in the provided list. For each bank, we call the get_sustainability_cost function to retrieve the sustainability cost before the reduction of service fees. If the fee_reduction parameter is True, we call the get_sustainability_cost_after_fee_reduction function to retrieve the sustainability cost after the reduction. Otherwise, we use the same sustainability cost value for both before and after the reduction.\n\nWe then calculate the savings by subtracting the cost after the reduction from the cost before the reduction. Finally, we add the calculated savings information to the result dictionary.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the get_sustainability_cost and get_sustainability_cost_after_fee_reduction functions are already implemented and can retrieve the required data. These functions can be implemented based on the specific requirements of the company's sustainability"}
