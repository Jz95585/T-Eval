You have access to a dataset containing various features related to user behavior and demographic information.\n\nHere's the task:\n\nDevelop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a user churning from a subscription-based service based on their past behavior and demographic information.\n\nDataset:\n\nThe dataset contains the following features:\n\n1. User ID\n2. Subscription status (active/inactive)\n3. Number of logins in the past month\n4. Average time spent on the service per login\n5. Number of purchases made in the past month\n6. Average purchase value\n7. Age\n8. Gender\n9. Location\n10. Device type\n11. Last login date\n12. Last purchase date\n\nTask:\n\nDevelop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a user churning from a subscription-based service based on their past behavior and demographic information.\n\nOutput:\n\nThe output should be a binary prediction indicating whether the user will churn or not.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Preprocess the data:\n   - Convert the subscription status feature to a binary classification problem (0 for active and 1 for inactive)\n   - Convert the categorical features (gender, location, device type) into numerical features using one-hot encoding or label encoding\n   - Normalize the numerical features using methods like Min-Max Scaler or Standard Scaler\n\n2. Split the data into training and testing sets:\n   - Split the data into training and testing sets using techniques like stratified sampling or random sampling\n   - Ensure that the training and testing sets have a similar distribution of churned and non-churned users\n\n3. Develop the machine learning model:\n   - Choose an appropriate algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, etc.) based on the nature of the problem and the type of features\n   - Train the model using the training data and tune hyperparameters using cross-validation or grid search\n   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve\n\n4. Use the trained model to make predictions:\n   - Apply the trained model to the testing data to generate binary predictions (0 for non-churning users and 1 for churning users)\n   - Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using the same metrics used in step 3\n\n5.
