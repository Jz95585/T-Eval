Based on this, it is recommended to adjust the automated strategy to further enhance diversity."}], "prediction": "Answer the question: What is the recommended approach to adjusting the automated strategy to further enhance diversity?\n\nStep-by-step response:\n\n1. Identify the main goal: The main goal is to adjust the automated strategy to further enhance diversity.\n\n2. Analyze the current automated strategy: Since the analysis shows that automated strategies have a higher diversity in asset classes compared to traditional human-managed strategies, it is important to understand how the current automated strategy is constructed and implemented.\n\n3. Determine the areas for improvement: Identify specific areas within the automated strategy that could benefit from further diversity enhancement. This could include the asset allocation model used, the investment universe, or the risk management approach.\n\n4. Assess the limitations of the current strategy: Consider any limitations of the current automated strategy that may be hindering its ability to further enhance diversity. This could include constraints imposed by the investment manager or the investment vehicles used.\n\n5. Develop alternative approaches: Brainstorm alternative approaches that could be used to further enhance diversity within the automated strategy. This could include using more diverse asset classes, expanding the investment universe, or incorporating more advanced risk management techniques.\n\n6. Evaluate and prioritize the alternative approaches: Assess the potential benefits and drawbacks of each alternative approach, and prioritize those that are most likely to enhance diversity while minimizing potential risks.\n\n7. Implement the recommended approach: Once the most promising alternative approach has been identified, implement it within the automated strategy. This could involve modifying the asset allocation model, expanding the investment universe, or incorporating new risk management techniques.\n\n8. Continuously monitor and adjust: Regularly monitor the performance of the automated strategy and assess whether it is achieving its intended objectives. If necessary, make further adjustments to the strategy to ensure that it continues to effectively enhance diversity.\n\nAnswer: The recommended approach to adjusting the automated strategy to further enhance diversity involves analyzing the current strategy, identifying areas for improvement, assessing limitations, developing alternative approaches, evaluating and prioritizing options, implementing the recommended approach, and continuously monitoring and adjusting the strategy as needed."}
