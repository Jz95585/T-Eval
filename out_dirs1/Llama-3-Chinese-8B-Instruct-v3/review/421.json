Black tea: Black tea is fully oxidized and has a strong, rich flavor. It is often consumed with milk and sugar to balance out the bitterness.\n3. Oolong tea: Oolong tea is partially oxidized and has a smooth, complex flavor profile. It is often described as being somewhere between green and black tea in terms of taste.\n4. White tea: White tea is made from the young buds of tea plants and has a light, delicate flavor and aroma. It is often consumed for its health benefits and is considered to be one of the most expensive types of tea.\n5.
