In order to do so, I need to understand the context of your inquiry.\n\nIn this case, you have asked me about getting the main emerging market countries' energy supply data. This is a specific and relevant topic that is of interest to many individuals and organizations.\n\nTo provide you with the most accurate and up-to-date information, I would suggest using reliable and credible sources such as official government statistics, international organizations like the International Energy Agency (IEA), or reputable research institutions.\n\nHere is a general data on the main emerging market countries' energy supply:\n\n* China: The world's largest energy consumer and second-largest oil consumer. In 2020, China's energy supply was 4.71 billion metric tons of oil equivalent (MTOE).\n* India: With a population of over 1.3 billion people, India is the second-most populous country globally. India's energy supply was 902 million MTOE in 2020.\n* Brazil: As the largest economy in Latin America and the eighth-largest in the world, Brazil's energy supply was 437 million MTOE in 2020.\n* South Africa: With an economy heavily reliant on fossil fuels, South Africa's energy supply was 227 million MTOE in 2020.\n\nPlease note that these figures are based on the most recent data available from 2020. Energy supply data can change over time due to various factors such as changes in government policies, global economic conditions, and technological advancements.\n\nIf you would like to obtain more detailed and specific information on the energy supply of these countries, I recommend consulting the sources mentioned earlier or using other reliable sources."}
