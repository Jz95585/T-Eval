In fact, heart disease is responsible for approximately one-third of all deaths in the US each year. Other leading causes of death in the US include cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases, accidents (unintentional injuries), and stroke.\n\nIt's worth noting that the leading causes of death can vary slightly depending on the population being considered. For example, the CDC reports that among adults aged 65 years and older, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death, after heart disease, cancer, and stroke. Additionally, the leading causes of death can differ by race and ethnicity, with certain health disparities affecting different populations."}
